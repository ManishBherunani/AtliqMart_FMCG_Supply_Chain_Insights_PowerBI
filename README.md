## Project Overview
Atliq Mart, a fast-growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, operates in **Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara**.  
The company plans to expand into metro and tier-1 cities within the next two years and is focusing on strengthening its **supply chain efficiency**.

This project analyzes **daily delivery data across customers, products, and cities** to:
- Identify gaps in the supply chain  
- Improve delivery efficiency  
- Enable data-driven decisions to support expansion  

---

## Problem Statement
Atliq Mart has faced **customer dissatisfaction**, with some key customers not renewing contracts due to poor service.  
Key issues identified:
- Products not delivered **on time**  
- Products not delivered **in full**  

The supply chain analytics team was tasked with tracking:  
- **On-Time Delivery (OT %)**  
- **In-Full Delivery (IF %)**  
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF %)**  

on a **daily basis**, against customer-defined targets.

---

## Project Summary
This project evaluates **delivery performance** by tracking:
- OT %, IF %, OTIF %, **Line Fill Rate (LIFR %)**, and **Volume Fill Rate (VOFR %)**  
- Performance across **customers, products, and cities**  
- Gaps between **actual results vs. target values**  

The insights guide **operational improvements** and highlight areas needing attention before expansion.

---

## Project Objective
1. **Track Key Delivery Metrics**  
   - OT %, IF %, OTIF %, LIFR %, VOFR % (daily basis).  

2. **Evaluate Metrics Against Customer Targets**  
   - Measure each customer’s performance against predefined targets.  

3. **Analyse City-Level Performance**  
   - Break down OT %, IF %, OTIF % by city to highlight regional gaps.  

4. **Product-Wise Analysis**  
   - Identify top & bottom performing products impacting fulfilment.  

---

## Metric Understanding
- **Line Fill Rate (LIFR %):** % of order lines shipped vs. total lines ordered.  
- **Volume Fill Rate (VOFR %):** % of quantity shipped vs. ordered.  
- **In-Full Delivery (IF %):** Order delivered only if all items match requested quantities.  
- **On-Time Delivery (OT %):** Order delivered only if all items arrive by the agreed time.  
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF %):** Order delivered both on-time and in-full.

### 2. Evaluate Metrics Against Their Target for Customers

**Overall Performance**  
- VOFR % strong (**95%–98%**) → most ordered volume delivered.  
- LIFR % variable (**52%–76%**) → challenges in fulfilling full line items.
